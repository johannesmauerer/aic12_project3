The importer Class is for importing tweets 

When an importer gets instantiated, its constructors takes two Strings as input. 
One is the Name of the File that has to be imported. The other one is the name of a properties file, which saves the state of an import.

The state gets saved as a float number in form of a private variable in the Importer class.
Whenever a line gets imported in the Database it saves the state to a properties file
